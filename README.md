## Project Description
When planning a vacation, consolidating visa, currency, and COVID restriction information is a monstrous task. Here at Planer, we plan on bringing the correct information for travelers, making it easier to choose your next big vacation.

### The problem
Before going on a vacation, the first step is to plan and schedule. Visa requirements, COVID and travel restrictions, weather, and currency are essential factors to take into consideration in determining a destination. However, this information is scattered and hard to sift through on your own, so travelers already have to go through a lot of hassles to gather the correct information. Planer aims to make planning an easy process by bringing the information to travelers.

### App Categories
Travel Planning, Travel Information (Covid Restriction, Exchange Rate, Airport, News)

### Preliminary app idea
Planer is an app designed to help travelers determine their travel destination and make trip planning as easy as possible. We will accomplish this by consolidating visa requirements, COVID/travel restrictions, currency, and weather information on one page. Additionally, we allow users to save their favorite countries. This helps users follow and keep track of a certain country's travel information for their next trip.

#### We will have the following pages.
- Login
- Register to save the home country in the profile
- Consolidated travel Information (Visa, covid, weather, currency, airports, news)
- Favourites to revisit the list of countries saved
- User Profile to change the home country
